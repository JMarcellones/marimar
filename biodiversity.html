					<p>Our planet is home to an estimated 8.1 million species of plants and animals, a dizzying total that includes the elephants roaming the Serengeti and the worms in the soil of your local park. Together, with an even greater number of microorganisms, these species define the earth’s ecosystems—and some 80 percent of them have yet to be officially identified.Protecting this remarkable diversity of life is about more than scientific discovery. Biodiversity remains a primary indicator of our planet’s health and underpins every facet of our society—from our foods and medicines to our cultures to our ability to withstand extreme weather.But right now, nature is in crisis.Plant and animal species are disappearing tens to hundreds of times faster than at any time in the last 10 million years, and that pace is accelerating. If we fail to curb threats to nature, from habitat destruction to climate change, scientists warn that one million plant and animal species face extinction—and many within just decades.</p>
					<p>Biodiversity can be defined as the “variety of life in our natural world” and is measured as the number of different species—including plants, animals, fungi, algae, and even microorganisms, like bacteria—that share a certain home region. Biodiversity is a key indicator of the health of an ecosystem. Areas with particularly high levels of biodiversity, like the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument or the Amazon rainforest, are considered biodiversity hot spots and provide habitat to numerous endemic species, which are species unique to that place.Thriving biodiversity is necessary for healthy ecosystems, without which we wouldn’t have a secure food supply, clean water, essential medicines, or, ultimately, a habitable climate.	</p>
						<h2>Ecological Importance</h2>
					<p>At its most essential, biodiversity improves the stability and resilience of an ecosystem. The more complex an ecosystem—the more abundant and variable its life and resources—the more likely it is that some of its species will have the ability to withstand stressors like drought, disease, or a changing climate.“Say you raze a healthy forest and plant a single monoculture crop in its place,” explains NRDC forest conservation expert Jennifer Skene. “And then you have an infestation break out. That infestation is going to be able to completely devastate the entire field. However, in a diverse ecosystem, some species may be affected—but chances are that some of them will be naturally less vulnerable and survive. That allows for the ecosystem to maintain a foothold and bounce back without total destruction.”Biodiversity is also critical for maintaining an ecosystem’s web of codependencies. In every ecosystem, species rely on each other, supplying one another with shelter and food, for instance. When species start to disappear—whether it’s apex predators or the fungi that decompose dead material—the system of checks and balances begins to go awry.Take the example of the sea otter, a keystone species. If sea otter populations decline, populations of one of its primary prey, sea urchins, then explode. Too many urchins can lead the sea kelp grasses, on which the urchins feed, to decline—removing the food and habitat for a number of other species.</p>

							<p> In the broadest sense, is equivalent to the natural world, physical world, or material world. "Nature" refers to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. It ranges in scale from the subatomic to the cosmic. </p>
							<p>"Nature" can include living things like plants and animals, weather, geological processes, and scientific concepts like matter and energy. The phrase is frequently used to describe the "natural environment" or wilderness, which includes untamed wildlife, rocks, forests, beaches, and other places that have not been significantly impacted by human activity or that continue to exist in spite of it. For instance, unless specifically defined as "human nature" or "the whole of nature," manufactured items and human interaction are typically not seen as a component of nature. This more conventional definition of "nature" suggests a separation between the natural and artificial components of the planet, with the latter being defined as having been created by human consciousness or the human mind.</p>
